= An LLM powered microservice for parsing phone numbers

I was recently reminded of a tweet from 3 years that described how some websites make difficult to enter information, such as a phone number:

The obvious solution is to use today's golden hammer: an LLM.

== About this project

This project is a simple Python-based microservice that uses OpenAI to validate and parse phone numbers.

Running the service:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>

$ uvicorn --reload service_api:app
```

Validating and parsing phone numbers:

```shell
$ http POST localhost:8000/parse ph
oneNumber=5105551212
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 27
content-type: application/json
date: Fri, 29 Mar 2024 22:25:58 GMT
server: uvicorn
{
    "result": "(510) 555-1212"
}
```

and

```shell
$ http POST localhost:8000/parse phoneNumber=510555121
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
content-type: application/json
date: Fri, 29 Mar 2024 22:26:26 GMT
server: uvicorn
```

== How it works

The service uses https://www.langchain.com[Langchain], which is a popular Python framework, to invoke OpenAI's LLM to parse the phone number. 

The code invokes the LLM with a prompt that instructs the LLM to validate the phone and, if it's correct, return it in a standard format.

== Parody warning

The timing of this project is not a coincidence. It's a parody of the current state of the industry where it seems like every problem is solved by an LLM.

Having said that, this project is a simple example of how to use an LLM to solve what could be a real-world problem.
